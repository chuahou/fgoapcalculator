A simple app that calculates when AP will be refilled to:

1. the desired level, and 
2. the maximum capacity.

The `personal` branch contains my personal preferred app with Saber graphics and
Japanese text, while the `master` branch contains the English version with no
licensed graphics for publishing.

## Release on Play Store

This app will be released on the Google Play Store. It is currently undergoing review, and when published, the link will
be added here.
