A simple app that calculates when AP will be refilled to:

1. the desired level, and 
2. the maximum capacity.

The `personal` branch contains my personal preferred app with Saber graphics and
Japanese text, while the `master` branch contains the English version with no
licensed graphics for publishing.

## Release on Play Store

The English version without graphics can be found on the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.chuahou.fgo_ap_reminder).
